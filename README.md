# Project Scope

You are a group of creative, innovative, and energetic programmers who intend to grab the text from
the internet with aim of analysing textual data such as customer feedback, social media conversations
and textual documents to understand customer experiences, preferences and needs with
consideration of diverse cultural differences.
Each team shall come up with the project proposal, collect textual data using web scraping with
python, clean data with text pre-processing and build text classification model. 




## Description of business Area


The streaming services have been blooming and genre has been an important part in movies, which we will be investigating in. A movie's genre determines its structure and type of audience.Streaming services categorise their content according to genre, such as action, comedy, drama, and others. It makes it easy for users to find and browse content they are interested in. Genre classification is also used for targeted advertising and content recommendations. Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney Plus dominate the streaming services industry.


## Business Scenario

We are an upcoming media streaming company,ZenStream, that is interested in improving their recommendation system for their users. For content streaming companies to succeed in this business area, they must understand the media and entertainment industry, as well as their target audience preferences and viewing habits.Despite having a large dataset of user reviews, these reviews do not include the genre of the content. Users' reviews will be used to classify the genre of each piece of content. By analysing this information, they will be able to improve their recommendation algorithm and suggest content that users will be more likely to enjoy based on their previously expressed preferences. The classification project involves training a machine learning model on a dataset of labelled reviews, with the label representing the genre of the content, and then using that model to predict the genre of new, unseen reviews.
## Objective

The business objective for a classification project that classifies genre by looking at user reviews is to enhance the media streaming company's recommendation system. The company will be able to match content to user preferences better by accurately categorising movies and TV shows based on user reviews. As a result, users will be more inclined to find content they enjoy, increasing engagement and retention. Increasing subscribers and consumption of content will ultimately drive revenue growth for the company. Furthermore, the classification project will help the media streaming company to understand their user's preferences, which will help them to create targeted marketing campaigns and to improve their content curation.
## Key Tasks

1) **Key Task 1: Project Proposal**

Identify a business problem and objectives that is related to text
classification area


2) **Key Task 2: Collect text data using web scraping**

Scrape text data on the internet programmatically
using python. The techniques to collect data should comply with data protection and privacy
ethics.

3) **Key Task 3: Perform data cleansing**

Apply text pre-processing technique in ITB241 Natural Language
Processing to clean the unstructured textual data and prepare it so that it can be used for modelling.

4) **Key Task 4: Text classification modelling**

- In the modelling task, the team should apply relevant text classification modelling techniques on the data. 
- You should build and train multiple models.
- You should assess and compare the trained models to identify the best possible outcome.
